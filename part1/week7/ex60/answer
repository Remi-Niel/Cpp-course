The problem that causes the second output to be 0 is the fact that the eofbit of the stream is still set after assigning it a new string. 

The istringstream::str function does not clear the condition flags previously set. When the istream::operator>> is used it first constructs a sentry object that,
among other functions, checks whether any of the condition flags have been set, and which in this case sets the failbit because it encounters the eofbit.

Because the failbit is set, the istream::operator>> does not perform the extraction, and no2 remains 0.

The fix is to clear the condition flags with istr.clear() anywhere between the first and second extraction.
