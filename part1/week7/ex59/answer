When using constructor with a filename for fstream. The failbit is set if the file cannot be opened. 
This is because you have to provide the correct flags to tell fstream what you want it to do. Since no such flags are provided
it does not create the file and therefore fails to open it setting the failbit and prints nothing.

Ofstream by default is for output and generates the file or empties it if it alread exists. Hence its output is shown.
