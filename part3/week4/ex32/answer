The result of the expression will be a temporary Expr<LHS, RHS, std::plus> object, with the LHS being Expr<LHS, RHS, std::plus> and RHS an std::vector<int>. 
Note that this structure repeats untill for Expr<LHS,RHS,std::plus> both LHS and RHS are std::vector<int>.

Note that at this point no actual index computations have been performed. The index computations are only actually performed,
if and when the returned Expr object "operator VType()" member is used.

In which case N * (K + 1) index computations will be performed, where K is the amount of vectors and N the amount of elements in a vector.

K + 1 because K times for every element because the to be summed elements need to be processed, + 1 because a index computation is needed
for the location where you are going to store the result.
