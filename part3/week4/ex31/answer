line 45 returns an value_type by calling cpt() from an Operation struct defined using the operation template argument given to BinExpr.
Hence if MUL is given to BinExpr, Operation must be have an cpt() member. However the unspecialized template doesn't have this member,
which means that Operation<LH, RH, MUL>.cpt(d_lhs[ix], d_rhs[ix]); does not exist hence the compiler gives errors.

ADD and SUB don't give these error because their specializations of Operation do contain the cpt member.
