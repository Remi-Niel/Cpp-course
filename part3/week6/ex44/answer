When a NUMBER is encountered in can either be reduced to the non-terminal number and then to the 
non-terminal expression or it can be directly reduced to the non-terminal expression. This
is a source of ambiguity.

Another problem is that the operators '+' and '-' can either shift or reduce. Right now it is
basically missing information about order of operations.
