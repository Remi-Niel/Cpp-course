Without if statement: 

real	0m1,018s
user	0m1,018s
sys	0m0,000s

With if statement:

real	0m0,670s
user	0m0,657s
sys	0m0,012s

The version that simply checks the goodbit is faster than the one that attempts
to print, but is stopped when it encounters the failbit.

A possible reason for this is the extra function call to ostream::operator<<,
which includes the string literal argument's reference.

A good rule of thumb would be to prefer checking the state of a stream over
attempting an operation when the operation is repeated and expected to fail often.
