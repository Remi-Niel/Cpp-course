\textbf{what's the required expression statement?}
\begin{verbatim}
d_forkPtr[d_nFork++] = fork.clone();
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{What must change in Fork?}
Fork must be made to be an Abstract Base class. With a pure virtual private member:
\begin{verbatim}
virtual Fork *copy() = 0;
\end{verbatim}

It also needs a public method which calls the virtual copy method and passes the result back.

\begin{verbatim}
Fork *clone() const; //calls copy
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{if main looks like this: \texttt{ret.}}
Compile needs to override the copy method of Fork.
